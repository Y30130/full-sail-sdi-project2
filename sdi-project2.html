<p>The theme I used for my project continued from my project last week. I chose Britney Spears again, but this time the scenario was from the other side. The story told through the code is that Britney Spears will be taking a promo tour. The variables allow manipluation of many facors including how many total shows, duration of each song and show, conditional elements that determine whether or not she will be able to perform using specific props, and is also scalable to fit other female artists by replacing the &quot;recordingArtist&quot; variable.</p>
